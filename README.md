What?
=====
A graphical Python application which can automatically grab vehicle data (e.g. price, specifications, features etc.) from the Australian automotive website http://redbook.com.au. Vehicle images as well as page screenshots can also be grabbed. This data can then be exported to an Excel file.

Why?
====
This application was a personal project of mine and here were some of my motivations for creating it:  
1. To learn to create graphical applications using PyQt  
2. To learn more about automated web browsing and data grabbing, in particular using multiple threads to speed up the process  
3. To see if it was possible!

How?
====
This application uses PhantomJS (a headless browser) in combination with Selenium (a web automation framework) to automatically grab the data. PyQt provides a neat and easy-to-use user-interface for the application.

The application can be run on both Windows and Linux.
